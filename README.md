# Netflix-Tv-Shows-Movies-Analysis
Netflix Tv Shows & Movies Analysis with Tableau is a data visualization project that involves using Tableau software to analyze and explore data
related to Netflix's TV shows and movies. The data can be gathered from a variety of sources, such as public datasets or through web scraping.
The project aims to provide insights and answers to questions such as:
•	What are the most popular TV shows and movies on Netflix?
•	Which genres are the most popular among Netflix users?
•	What is the average rating of the TV shows and movies on Netflix?
•	How has the content on Netflix evolved over time?
Using Tableau, the data can be visualized in a variety of ways, such as bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and heat maps.
Tableau also provides tools for filtering, sorting, and grouping data to help identify patterns and trends.
For example, a visualization could show the number of TV shows and movies in each genre, with the ability to filter by release year or rating.
This would allow viewers to see which genres are most prevalent and popular during certain time periods.
Additionally, a scatter plot could show the correlation between the length of a TV show or movie and its rating,
providing insights intowhether longer content tends to have higher ratings.
Overall, the Netflix-Tv-Shows-Movies-Analysis with Tableau project aims to provide valuable insights into the content
available on Netflix, which can be useful for content creators, marketers, and viewers alike.
